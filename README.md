# 👋 Hey, I'm Pete

**Senior Rust Engineer** | **Blockchain Developer** | **Rust Maxi 🦀**

I've spent the last 7+ years (almost) exclusively in the Web3 space, building distributed systems, p2p messaging protocols, testing frameworks, and backend services — yes, all 100% Rust.

## 🔧 What I Do

- **Distributed Systems** - Building scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure
- **P2P Protocols** - Designed messaging protocols using Rust, Waku, and libp2p
- **Developer Tools** - Created the first full-fledged testing framework for The Graph subgraphs
- **Smart Contracts** - Started with Ethereum/Aeternity, now focused on Rust-based chains

## 💼 Currently

Senior Rust Engineer at **Fathom.io**, building high-performance DataOps/AI platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Rust (primary), TypeScript, Kotlin, AssemblyScript
**Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solana, The Graph, Polkadot/Substrate
**Rust Ecosystem:** Tokio, Actix-web, Yew.rs, libp2p, Waku
**Other:** React, Next.js, Docker, AWS, GraphQL

## 🌍 Journey

From accountant to Senior Rust Engineer — quite the adventure. The transition taught me the value of precision, systematic thinking, and attention to detail. Started with Ethereum smart contracts and React frontends, fell in love with Rust, and haven't looked back.
